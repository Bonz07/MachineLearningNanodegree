## Proposal

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

For my Capstone prpject I will be using a deep learning approach to attempt to solve the Humpback Whale Identification project on Kaggle <sup>[1]</sup>. This is a similar image classification challenge to the dog breed classification challenge in the Deep Learning section of the Machine Learning Nanodegree. I have chosen this domain as I care deeply about our oceans and maratime life. I have been fascinated by whales since visiting the Natural History Museum, London, as a child with my father and seeing the full skeleton of the blue whale. They are truely magnificent creatures, giants of the sea and I feel passionately about helping organisations that support and monitor them. This project appeals to me as the work will help contribute to HappyWhale's [^2] understand of the movement of whales by using machine learning to dramatically increse the efficiency of this identification work. 

I am keen to test my understanding of image recognition machine learning approaches using Deep Learning as there are several additional projects I would like to conduct upon completion of my Nanodegree. Therefore I hope this Capstone Project will be the foundation of further work for me in this field.


*academic research (and why it is relevent)
*historical information relevant to this project, number of whales globally, how long this process usually takes, geographical spread, challenge of whales being mainly underwater, importance of tracking the whales and their population
*good fit for machine learning project as it is essentially a image recognition challenge, as the whales tails (flutes) are deemed to be unique like a fingerprint



### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
